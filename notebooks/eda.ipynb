But after I told Lone boatman that he was synthesizing (not \"\"paraphrasing\"\" as he claimed), he changed the whole page by turning it into an article like Wikipedia's \"\"entrenched clause\"\" article. And suddenly today many \"\"editors\"\" showed up, as though Lone boatman contacted them to form what he claims is a \"\"consensus\"\". There is no \"\"consensus,\"\" just an attack on the article. I have tried to discuss with these \"\"editiors,\"\" but they do not discuss - only insist on having it their way - acting at whim, threatening to have me blocked if I write again. Lone boatman always gets the last say, because he deletes and changes things and then threatens me. And he lies in his complaints about me. And I have tried to reach an authorized Wikipedia administrator, but have not been able to. In the meantime Lone boatman tells me he has deleted my complaint to an administrator.  \"</td>\n",

And as for the protection, well it's hard to believe that that's a genuine question from someone who innocently and genuinely is wondering and has no intent to harass and annoy another user. I'll give you a little piece of advice it you want to avoid being blocked for disruption and harassment. If someone deletes something from his own talk page, assume that he has read it and do NOT  attempt to repost it. If you are sufficiently familiar with Wikipedia to be able to check logs and know who deleted or protected a particular page, then you are also have sufficient knowledge to be able to work out for yourself why the page you refer to was deleted and protected, whether or not you agree with the decision.  ♫ \"</td>\n",

While I agree with DrW, Nick and anon about it not being psychological enough, and encourage them to make additions where they think there are deficits, I don't think that the material presented here is off-base.\\n So. What I'd like to suggest is that we list off the sorts of material covered in psychological social psychology, and then work that into the article.   \n",

       "23106   \"\\n\\nThe article is gone, Lone boatman and others hacked it to pieces - and now they have deleted it completely, replacing it with what you see. The 'Eternity clause' article was about Germany's 'eternity clause,' how it functions, its purpose in securing the fundamental principles of democracy, and the history of it. But after I told Lone boatman that he was synthesizing (not \"\"paraphrasing\"\" as he claimed), he changed the whole page by turning it into an article like Wikipedia's \"\"entrenched clause\"\" article. And suddenly today many \"\"editors\"\" showed up, as though Lone boatman contacted them to form what he claims is a \"\"consensus\"\". There is no \"\"consensus,\"\" just an attack on the article. I have tried to discuss with these \"\"editiors,\"\" but they do not discuss - only insist on having it their way - acting at whim, threatening to have me blocked if I write again. Lone boatman always gets the last say, because he deletes and changes things and then threatens me. And he lies in his complaints about me. And I have tried to reach an authorized Wikipedia administrator, but have not been able to. In the meantime Lone boatman tells me he has deleted my complaint to an administrator.  \"   \n",

And as for the protection, well it's hard to believe that that's a genuine question from someone who innocently and genuinely is wondering and has no intent to harass and annoy another user. I'll give you a little piece of advice it you want to avoid being blocked for disruption and harassment. If someone deletes something from his own talk page, assume that he has read it and do NOT  attempt to repost it. If you are sufficiently familiar with Wikipedia to be able to check logs and know who deleted or protected a particular page, then you are also have sufficient knowledge to be able to work out for yourself why the page you refer to was deleted and protected, whether or not you agree with the decision.  ♫ \"   \n",

No wonder you are considered a MORON!!!!! You really think that Communists and the Nehru family are not part of the coalition. \\n What is the connection between White Supremacists and Communists? In India, they are part of the same alliance along with the Jihadis. Wait, you are going to dispute this too! Proves pretty much that you are mentally inferior and have no brains. According to Communists in India, White supremacists like you are USEFUL IDIOTS and they can make you support the Communist coalition and make you support Nehru's Stalinist ideas. You are a living proof of that claim by Communists. \\n BTW, your book on text processing sucks and I shall spread the word that it is an inferior book not worth reading. \\n Now you also claim that I posted the notice. This proves that you are a White Supremacist.  \n",

To answer your question, I have, but only in jest.  It's hard for me to avoid saying a meme when it fits the situation.  If you have any more questions for me, I'd suggest asking in a new section on my talk page though.  This isn't a great place to ask personal questions.  \n",

Just kidding. So one would think I would be satisfied with such a complete and helpful answer, but here I am still droning on, asking you to clarify. But this is kind of interesting, check this out, and you will see what I meant in my question above: Go back to the file delete discussion page: Wikipedia:Files for deletion/2015 February 25#File:P1010534.JPG and there are two links I'd like to click on. The first is when you say, \"\"I have uploaded it to File:Portrait of SS Standartenfuehrer Franz Ziereis.jpg.\"\" The second is when you provide the file image to the right of that statement. Click on both. Notice how, for the first link, the Wikipedia logo is in the top left and the URL is wikipedia.org, and for the second, it isn't?  Cool, huh?  I had only clicked on the first, saw the Wikipedia logo and the URL, and assumed you had created a local file instead of linking to Commons, so I had asked my original question. I wonder what is happening with that first link, showing us the Wikipedia logo and URL as if it is a local page?   \"  \n",

The book was published less than 90 days ago; an external link may develop in the future listing all the errors in detail, last seen in the archive here. Mathewignash I wish you would stop using the catch-all excuse of Original research (please review the definition). Wikipedia articles require some original writing; otherwise it would be nothing but copying and pasting. The errors I listed were high-quality sourced. The problem is that there aren't any external websites yet discussing the errors in detail to justify creating a new and separate article. Maybe there never will be. The publisher/editor of North & South informed me that they will post the Steers four-page book review on their website. When that happens, the link will be included in the article.   16:04, 20  "
